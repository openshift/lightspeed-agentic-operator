# Temporary Audit Log Storage — Agentic Operator

Implementation details for the agentic-operator's role in the templog feature.

## Behavioral Rules

### Configuration

1. The agentic-operator reads Collector connectivity from a well-known ConfigMap (`lightspeed-otel-collector-client`) in the operator namespace, created by the lightspeed-operator.
2. The ConfigMap contains: `collector-endpoint` (OTLP gRPC host:port), `admin-endpoint` (HTTPS admin API), `ca.crt` (TLS CA certificate), `credentials-secret` (optional).
3. Two valid ConfigMap states exist:
    - **Disabled:** empty data / no `collector-endpoint` — OTLP export is off (stdout audit continues). Used by quickstart/e2e without a Collector.
    - **Enabled:** `collector-endpoint` (host:port), `admin-endpoint` (`https://…`), and parseable `ca.crt` PEM are all required. When `credentials-secret` is set, the named Secret in the operator namespace must contain `tls.crt` and `tls.key` (standard TLS Secret keys); those PEMs are loaded into the OTLP and admin HTTPS clients for mTLS. When the key is omitted, trust is CA-only (current lightspeed-operator default).
4. On startup, the operator blocks until the ConfigMap exists (5 minute timeout). Missing ConfigMap or an **invalid enabled** ConfigMap is fatal. An empty/disabled ConfigMap is success.
5. A controller-runtime informer watches the ConfigMap for runtime changes. On a valid change, exporters are rebuilt then the previous providers are shut down. On an **invalid enabled** update, export is disabled (old config is not retained) and an error is logged; reconcile does not retry.

### OTLP Log Emission

6. When the Collector is configured, the agentic-operator emits audit events as OTLP log records to it. When disabled or unconfigured, OTLP emission is a no-op. Whether records are stored depends on the Collector's pipeline configuration (managed by the lightspeed-operator).
7. Structured JSON to stdout always emits unconditionally. Stdout emission is not configurable — it is always on. This is dual emission: stdout + OTLP (when enabled).
8. Each OTLP log record carries:
   - `agenticrun.uid` as a log record attribute (AgenticRun `metadata.uid`, raw UUID with hyphens — collector normalizes to 32-char hex on INSERT)
   - `agenticrun.phase` as a log record attribute (the current audit phase: `analysis`, `approval`, `execution`, `verification`, `escalation`, `terminal`)
   - `event` as a log record attribute (the event discriminator, e.g., `audit.agenticrun.received`)
   - The full structured JSON audit event as the log record body
9. When the Collector is not configured (ConfigMap absent at runtime after initial startup), OTLP log emission is a no-op. Stdout continues unaffected.

### OTLP Trace Emission

10. The same ConfigMap-configured OTLP connection is used for trace spans (per-phase root spans). Traces and logs share the same endpoint and TLS configuration.
11. The `agenticrun.uid` log attribute stores the raw Kubernetes `metadata.uid` (with hyphens). The collector's `postgresexporter` normalizes it (strips hyphens) when writing to the `agentic_run_id` column. The OTel log record's native `TraceID` field carries the per-phase trace ID and is not used for templog column mapping.
12. Trace context is propagated to sandbox pods via the W3C `traceparent` header on agent HTTP calls.

### AgenticRun Finalizer

13. The `agentic.openshift.io/templog-cleanup` (and RBAC cleanup) finalizers are added the first time the controller reconciles any non-deleting AgenticRun — including already-terminal runs — so TTL or manual delete always runs Collector log cleanup.
14. When an AgenticRun CR is deleted and the finalizer is present:
    a. The operator calls the Collector admin API: `DELETE /api/v1/logs?agentic_run_id=<uid>` over HTTPS using the CA cert from the ConfigMap. The raw Kubernetes UID (with hyphens) is passed; the collector normalizes internally.
    b. On success, removes the finalizer — CR deletion proceeds.
    c. On failure, increments a retry counter annotation (`agentic.openshift.io/templog-cleanup-attempts`) and requeues after 30 seconds.
    d. After 3 failed attempts, removes the finalizer regardless — CR deletion proceeds. A warning is logged about orphaned log records.
15. The finalizer depends on the Collector admin API being reachable. If the Collector is permanently down, the finalizer gives up after 3 retries to avoid blocking CR deletion indefinitely.

## Edge Cases

- **Invalid enabled ConfigMap at startup.** Fatal — operator exits.
- **Invalid enabled ConfigMap at runtime.** Export disabled; old config discarded; error logged; no reconcile retry.
- **Collector unavailable during AgenticRun deletion.** The finalizer retries up to 3 times. After exhausting retries, the finalizer is removed and deletion proceeds. Log records become orphaned in Postgres — acceptable trade-off vs blocking deletion forever.
- **No rows to delete.** The Collector admin API returns HTTP 200 with `{"deleted": 0}`. The finalizer succeeds and is removed. No error.
- **ConfigMap deleted at runtime.** OTLP emission becomes no-op. Stdout continues. Admin API calls (finalizer) return nil immediately (no client configured). Finalizer is removed without cleanup.
- **Operator restart mid-cleanup.** The retry counter is stored as an annotation on the CR — survives restart. The operator resumes from the stored attempt count.
